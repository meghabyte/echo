# Echo: A Multi-Agent AI System for Patient-Centered Pharmacovigilance
## Supplementary Materials

This repository contains the complete implementation  for **Echo**, a multi-agent AI system that transforms patient narratives from Reddit into structured drug safety intelligence. Echo leverages four specialized language model agents to discover, validate, and contextualize novel drug-symptom associations from online health communities.


### Key Contributions 

#### Technical Innovation
- **First multi-agent pharmacovigilance system** using large language models
- **Systematic confounder identification** beyond simple drug-reaction associations
- **Automated hypothesis generation** with biomedical literature synthesis
- **Real-time patient voice integration** into safety surveillance

#### Clinical Impact Potential
- **Early signal detection**: Historical validation shows months-to-years lead time
- **Underreported ADR identification**: Quality-of-life issues missed by traditional systems
- **Mechanistic insights**: Actionable hypotheses for clinical investigation
- **Scalable methodology**: Adaptable to other therapeutic areas and data sources

### üìã System Overview

Echo operates through four specialized agents:
- **Explorer**: Extracts drug-symptom mentions from cancer subreddit discussions
- **Analyzer**: Quantifies associations through temporal, confidence, and community metrics
- **Verifier**: Cross-references against FDA databases to identify novel signals
- **Proposer**: Generates mechanistic hypotheses from biomedical literature
